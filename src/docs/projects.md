# Projects

In contentjet all content lives within projects. A Project acts as a namespace for grouping content for a specific domain, or more simply, projects are containers which hold content.

Users can be invited to join a project and may be assigned one of 3 roles, Author, Admin or Owner.

Anything inside a project is unique to that project and cannot be moved or shared with another project.
